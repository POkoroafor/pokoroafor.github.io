I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Cornell University, where I have the great fortune to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/'> Robert D. Kleinberg</a>. I completed my undergraduate at <a href='https://hmc.edu'>Harvey Mudd College</a> where I met <a href='https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/'>Prof. Ran Libeskind-Hadas</a> who got me really excited about algorithms and theoretical computer science.

My interests are broadly in theoretical computer science, especially in learning theory, algorithmic game theory and reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm working on calibrated forecasting of binary sequences in online setting, online median estimation and reward shaping in reinforcement learning.

Beyond academic research, I have completed multiple internships at Microsoft and currently volunteer with <a href='https://youngdatascientists.org'>Young Data Scientists</a> and MathAction. In my freetime, I love to play soccer and chess.
