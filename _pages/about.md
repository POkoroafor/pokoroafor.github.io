I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href='https://seas.harvard.edu/'>Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> with <a href='https://dwork.seas.harvard.edu/'>Cynthia Dwork</a>. Prior to this, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Cornell University, where I have the great fortune to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/'> Robert D. Kleinberg</a>. I completed my undergraduate at <a href='https://hmc.edu'>Harvey Mudd College</a> where I met <a href='https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/'>Prof. Ran Libeskind-Hadas</a> who got me really excited about algorithms and theoretical computer science.

My research interests are broadly in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and computer science, especially in learning theory and reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm working on uncertainty estimation techniques in adversarial online learning.

Besides academic research, I have completed software engineering internships at Microsoft and currently volunteer with <a href='https://youngdatascientists.org'>Young Data Scientists</a> and <a href='https://www.mathaction.org/'>MathAction</a>. In my freetime, I enjoy playing soccer and chess.
